## Manipulating strings
* print a character multiple times
```python
print '-' * 6  #output ------
```
* find a substring
```python
s = 'any_string'
print s.find('z')   #output -1
print s.find('y')   #output  2
print s.find('ny')  #output  1
```
* string slicing
```python
sentence = "any_sentence"
starting_point = sentence.find('went');
print starting_point                     #output -1    
substring = sentence[starting_point-1:]  #output ce
print substring
```

```python
sentence = "A NOUN went on a walk. It can VERB really fast."
noun_starting = sentence.find('NOUN')
verb_starting = sentence.find('VERB')
substring1 = sentence[:noun_starting]
substring2 = sentence[noun_starting+4:verb_starting]
substring3 = sentence[verb_starting+4:]
print 'Substring1:'   #output Substring1:
print substring1      #output A 
print 'Substring2:'   #output Substring2:
print substring2      #output  went on a walk. It can 
print 'Substring3:'   #output Substring3:
print substring3      #output  really fast.
```

* string replacing
```python
str = "this is string example....wow!!! this is really string"
print str.replace("is", "was")       #output: thwas was string example....wow!!! thwas was really string
print str.replace("is", "was", 3)    #output: thwas was string example....wow!!! thwas is really string
```


## Methods  
```python
def say_hello(name):  
    greeting = "Hello " + name + "!"  
    return greeting  
 
print say_hello("Miriam")  
print say_hello("Andy") 
```
